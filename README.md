# javascript-challenge

The goal of this challenge was use JavaScript in an html file to create a website on which to display ufo sighting data provided and to allow the user to filter the data. I used the provided index.html file for the website itself and app.js file to create the function to display the data as well as the way(s) to allow the user to filter the data.

Files included in this challenge: data.js, app.js, index.html, style.css

Dependencies used: JavaScript, CSS, HTML

My main takeaway from this project is that learning JavaScript is a great way to scrub and present data for websites so the information can be presented in a user friendly, easy to display format. It was interesting learning the similarities and differences between .js and .py coding and how to use JavaScript code to process and display the data to create a table. It was much less confusing than I thought it would be and I enjoyed learing about how to use the form and filter codes to manipulate the data.

The most difficult parts of the project were creating the multiple filter code to and creating the event listeners to activate the filters. It also took some time to find how to display the data in the table correctly. I decided to keep the "Filter Table" button on the UFO-Level-2 code as I believe it would be user friendly to have the button available but the user does not need to click on the button to filter the data. Simply typing in one of the filter searches and exiting the search box will cause the data to be filtered.

Overall, I found this homework challenge to be the quite challenging but a great learning experience as I hadn't had any previous experience .js files. The class activities provided a base knowledge of where to start but I did need to do some independent study regarding event listeners to get the code to work correctly. I am looking forward to more challenges like this one and I am excited to learn more about JavaSript and HTML coding.
